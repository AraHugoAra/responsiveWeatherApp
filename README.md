Yet another weather app done as a project for Matrice.io RNCP6 tuition.

For this project, I had to have one single HTML, JS(no framework) ans CSS file.
So yeah, it's pretty basic, but it has two API's 'communicating' which was the main goal.

Project's online here: https://smartest-weather-app.netlify.app/
